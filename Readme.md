## Purpose

The Task Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to help users efficiently organize, track, and manage their tasks. The system provides a full suite of features including user authentication, task creation and management, task categorization, task filtering, and user profile management. The application aims to enhance productivity by allowing users to:

- Create personal accounts with secure authentication
- Create, edit, and delete tasks with customizable attributes (title, description, due date, priority, status)
- Organize tasks into custom categories for better organization
- Filter and sort tasks based on various criteria (status, priority, category, due date)
- View task statistics and progress tracking via an intuitive dashboard
- Manage user profiles with customizable information
- View tasks in both list and calendar formats

The system utilizes modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data storage, delivering a responsive and intuitive user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Conceptual Design

The Task Management System follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React.js with React Bootstrap for UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication

### Backend Structure
- **Models**: Handle database interactions
  - `userModel.js`: Manages user accounts and authentication
  - `taskModel.js`: Handles task-related database operations
  - `categoryModel.js`: Manages categories and relationships with tasks
- **Controllers**: Process client requests
  - `userController.js`: User registration, login, profile management
  - `taskController.js`: Task CRUD operations
  - `categoryController.js`: Category management
- **Middleware**:
  - `auth.js`: JWT authentication validation
  - `errorHandler.js`: Consistent error handling

### Frontend Components
- **Authentication**: Login and Register pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview with task statistics
- **Task Management**: Task creation, editing, filtering, and viewing
- **Categories**: Category management and task organization
- **Profile**: User profile management
- **Navigation**: Consistent navigation across the application

### UI Screenshots
The following screenshots showcase the current user interface of the Task Management System:

**1. Login Page**  
The login page provides a clean interface for user authentication with username and password fields, a "Forgot password?" link, and a "Register" option for new users.

**2. Registration Page**  
The registration form collects essential user information including first name, last name, username, email, and password with appropriate validation messages to ensure data quality.

**3. Dashboard**  
The dashboard offers an overview of task status with counts for pending, in-progress, and completed tasks. It displays a completion rate progress bar, upcoming tasks, and provides both list and calendar views.

**4. Calendar View**  
The calendar view presents tasks organized by date in a monthly format, making it easy to visualize task distribution and due dates. Tasks are color-coded by priority and status.

**5. Task Management**  
The task management page displays all tasks with filtering options for status, priority, and categories. Users can search, sort, and manage their tasks efficiently from this central interface.

**6. Task Filtering**  
Advanced filtering capabilities allow users to search by keyword, filter by status, priority and category, and sort tasks according to different criteria in ascending or descending order.

**7. New Task Creation**  
The task creation modal provides fields for title, description, due date, priority, status, and category assignment, enabling users to create well-defined tasks.

**8. Categories Management**  
The categories page allows users to organize tasks by custom categories. Users can see task counts per category and manage tasks within specific categories.

**9. User Profile**  
The profile page displays user information including username, full name, email, bio, and registration date. Users can edit their profile information and change their password.
